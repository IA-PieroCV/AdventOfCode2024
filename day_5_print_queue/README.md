# Day 5: Print Queue

This day was really odd. The first part was incredible easy, but the second part, great lord. Even than the solution is pretty simple, the difficulty came from the design of the algorithm. Maybe the answer is simple for someone who is used to search and sorting algorithms, but for someone who only review algorithms like bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort or radix sort (I mean, the conventionals); this day is quite difficult.

## Rating
- Difficulty 🟢🟢🟢🟢⚫️ (4/5: Hard). Most of the difficult came from the second part. If you can design it quickly, my respects.
- Code complexity 🟢🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️(2/5: Barely complex). The code needs to be barely explained, as the sorting algorithm is not that obvious. The rest of the code is pretty straihtforward.
- Narrative 🟢🟢🟢⚫️⚫️ (3/5: Nice narrative). This challenge was kind of difficult to understand at the beggining. The time I spent solving it makes me understand it very well, but I guess this wasn't the most easy to understand.

## Leason learned
This day was hard, not gonna lie. I was used to get the AoC challenges and just get right to the code. This time I should spend some time on a board to create a sorting algorithm. The lesson I can get here is that maybe when algorithms are faced, it's worth to spend some time, at least a minimum, to desing it.
