# Day 4: Ceres Search

This day was easy, but kind of long in my approach. Not sure if it's difficult, but it gives me the sensation I did something wrong. I will try to get insights on this code from other solutions and maybe with AI, but I'm pretty comfortable with my solution by far.

## Rating
- Difficulty 🟢🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️ (2/5: Okey). Very easy to make, but long code in this solution.
- Code complexity 🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️⚫️(1/5: No complex). This code is quite understandable, even if it's long. The code is modularized so it is pretty easy to follow.
- Narrative 🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢4/5: (Excellent narrative). The challenge is pretty easy to understand and the edge cases are actually pretty simple to catch.

## Leason learned
This day is teaching me that maybe my instinc needs refinement. It's not bad to look for ideas on how to make solutions, even if we found a solution with our knowledge.
