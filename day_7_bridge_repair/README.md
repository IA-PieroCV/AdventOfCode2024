# Day 7: Bridge Repair

As much as this day takes me, it was actually fun to solve and not that complicated. The code is a mess, but I think it allows me to think faster on that. Of course it can be modularized and abstract some of the code, but I think I'll leave it as it is. A very enjoyable day!

## Rating
- Difficulty 🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️⚫️ (1/5: Easy). This day was quite simple. I guess I nailed it when I choose the algorithm to use. It must be mentioned that the code is incredible slow. Maybe because it has to eval a lot of operation combinations. But at the end, makes the work.
- Code complexity 🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️⚫️ (1/5: No complex). It uses the same approach for both parts of the day. So it should be extremelly easy to understand.
- Narrative 🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢 (5/5: Excellent narrative). This day was incredible understandable, so it was prettu okey. There were not edge cases this time, at least not at the proposed solution.

## Leason learned
This day was easy and interesting. It felt like a rest day. The leason here is that it's okey to take this kind of rests. It's true that I applied what I learned before, that involves desingning the algorithm before going to the code. So this is working!
