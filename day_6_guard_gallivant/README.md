# Day 6: Guard Gallivant

As much as this day takes me, it was actually fun to solve and not that complicated. The code is a mess, but I think it allows me to think faster on that. Of course it can be modularized and abstract some of the code, but I think I'll leave it as it is. A very enjoyable day!

## Rating
- Difficulty 🟢🟢🟢⚫️⚫️ (3/5: Medium). The case was okey in difficulty, not complicated edge cases or any challenge in particular. However, it takes time to make all the algorithm.
- Code complexity 🟢🟢🟢⚫️⚫️ (3/5: Quite complex). The code is a mess right now. It can be easily explained as organized, but as it is is not the best.
- Narrative 🟢🟢🟢🟢⚫️ (4/5: Good narrative). As the challenge was interesting, you have to be in a good mood to appreciate the narrative of this day. Fortunately, I did. So the way the problem is presented and the explanation of all the cases was enjoyable.

## Leason learned
This day was funny to solve actually. I should pay attention to the abstraction on implementation. Maybe that would make the code easier to make. However, not too complex challenge this day.
