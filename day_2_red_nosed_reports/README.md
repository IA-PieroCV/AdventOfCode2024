# Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports

This day was fire. I reviewed concepts on itertools Python's package to make this. The first part was kind of easy, think about the list as a group is challenging, but it's feasible.
The second part added an exponential layer of complexity on this solution, so it was more demanding to think about grouping operations. This is a design issue, as refactoring for second part maybe could make the challenge easier, but I was very commited with a progressive solution. I'll consider a refactor for following days.

## Rating
- Difficulty 🟢🟢🟢⚫️⚫️ (3/5: Medium). This is starting very good. Planning the solution is now more important. Sticking with first part or complementing is a critical decision.
- Code complexity 🟢🟢🟢🟢⚫️(4/5: Very complex). This code uses a lot of group operations. Even more for the second part. This is a problem as the solution is barely readable, but as it's made step by step, understanding the first part is just enough to understand the second one.
- Narrative 🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢(5/5: Excellent narrative). The challenge was very well explained and it was clear from end to end. Edge cases were also very noticeable, so it wasn't necessary to stick on particular examples.

## Leason learned
This day teach me something. I forgot the plot-twists on AoC regarding part two of the days. First part was quick, so I was very committed with this approach that I didn't even think of refactor my solution for second part. I really believe this was the right decision here. So the learned lesson here is to take the chance to think about refactoring on second part. No need to stick with a logic if that makes the solution way more complex.
