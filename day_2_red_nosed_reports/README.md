# Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports

This day was fire. I reviewed concepts on itertools Python's package to make this. The first part was kind of easy, think about the list as a group is challenging, but it's feasible.
The second part added an exponential layer of complexity on this solution, so it was more demanding to think about grouping operations. This is a design issue, as refactoring for second part maybe could make the challenge easier, but I was very commited with a progressive solution. I'll consider a refactor for following days.

## Rating
- Difficulty 🟢🟢🟢⚫️⚫️ (3/5: Medium). This is starting very good. Planning the solution is now more important. Sticking with first part or complementing is a critical decision.
- Code complexity 🟢🟢🟢🟢⚫️(4/5: Very complex). This code uses a lot of group operations. Even more for the second part. This is a problem as the solution is barely readable, but as it's made step by step, understanding the first part is just enough to understand the second one.
- Narrative 🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢(5/5: Excellent narrative). The challenge was very well explained and it was clear from end to end. Edge cases were also very noticeable, so it wasn't necessary to stick on particular examples.
