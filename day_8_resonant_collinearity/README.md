# Day 8: Resonant Collinearity

This day was extremelly funny. All lessons of previous days are being valuable now. This code was made from design, pseudocode and finally implementation. All of that allows to complete the code without any blocker.

- Difficulty 🟢🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️ (2/5: Okey). As this day was simple, it has some of complexity. Not so hard, but the way it was approached makes this challenge easy.
- Code complexity 🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️⚫️ (1/5: No complex). This is the most beautiful code until now.
- Narrative 🟢🟢🟢⚫️⚫️ (3/5: Okey narrative). I consider this day was kind of difficult to understand. I know some wave theory, so I guess that allows me to get the harmonics stuff. Actually a little blocker I got was the "zero" harmonic. Anyway, it was good to catch.

Is important for me to pay atention of all details of the challenge in text. Even there are some steps can be assumed, it is better to be safe than sorry.
