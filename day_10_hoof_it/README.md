# Day 10: Hoof It

This day was interesting because of a funny thing. I missunderstood the challenge at the first time haha. I made the part 2 when making the part 1 and that allows me to make the part two extremelly fast. Funny and ironic day.

## Rating
- Difficulty 🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️⚫️ (1/5: Easy). This day wasn't difficult at all. The most interesting thing is that using recursive function is always a pleasure, but an easy stuff to make.
- Code complexity 🟢🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️ (2/5: Barely complex). The usage of recursive make this code quite complex, but not too much. So it's pretty okey.
- Narrative 🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢 (5/5: Excellent narrative). The path finding problem was very well made. The part two wasn't that hard to understand due to being very illustrative. The examples were very well made.

## Leason learned
This day was a reminder that I have to follow more design stuff and read carefully. Some days will be like this one, but if there's more crucial that I could miss could potentially made my day way harder.
