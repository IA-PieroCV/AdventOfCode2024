# AdventOfCode2024
Solution for advent of code 2024. Using Python 3.12.7 :)

## Internal conventions
1. The solution will be written in Python based on an arbitrary logic. No code readibility or speed optimized guaranteed.
2. AI code is not used unless being incredible blocked. However, I will avoid using it as much as possible.
3. Use of third party packages is allowed. As there's an arbitrary logic, this is possible just in case the package didn't solve directly the solution.
