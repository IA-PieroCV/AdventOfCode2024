# Day 3: Mull It Over

This day was actually interesting. First time that I need to think about edge cases. The usage of re was actually very useful, didn't take me any time to look for documentation as this stuff I study very well.

## Rating
- Difficulty 🟢🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️ (2/5: Okey). I guess for first part is very easy. Second part has two edge cases to consider that are not that obvious.
- Code complexity 🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️⚫️(1/5: No complex). This code is the most readable till now. Even the regex code is not even hard.
- Narrative 🟢🟢🟢🟢🟢(5/5: Excellent narrative). The context of the day was very understandable. The challenge was easy to understand and very direct to make.

## Leason learned
This day was very simple aswell. I guess I take the right choice using regex. I was open to refactor the whole code, but this time wasn't necessary. The lesson here is that thinking in the worst scenario may help here. What assumptions I'm making in my current process? Is a good question to make. This allows me to add some edge cases handling.
