# Day 1: Historian Hysteria

This day was actually pretty easy. I take the opportunity to practice the usage of map and filter. No modularity was needed, so the data was used as it came.
I'm only in doubt of the usage of Counter, but it's okey as (1) Is part of the native Python packages and (2) I should know how to use it (I didn't use AI, so I guess it's okey).

## Rating
- Difficulty 🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️⚫️ (1/5: Easy). As a good day 1, this challenge is to get motivation I guess, so it was very straighforward.
- Code complexity 🟢🟢⚫️⚫️⚫️(2/5: Barely complex). For some people the usage of lambda, map, filter and zip stuff is confusing. I'm on that side, but this is a code that doesn't abuse of it.
- Narrative 🟢🟢🟢🟢⚫️(4/5: Good narrative). The context of the challenge and itself were very understandable and engaging. It's true that for the second part I didn't get till I saw the example, but it was pretty okey.

## Leason learned
This day was very simple. So maybe the lesson I got this day is to take it easy when it's needed. No need to look for the most optimized speed or the most readable solution if not needed (yet).
